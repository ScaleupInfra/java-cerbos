# Getting Started

## Installation

Run the following command in the frontend directory to install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run the following command to start a development server
```bash
npm start
```

Development server will start at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Now you can make changes accordingly and see the updates in real time.
To serve it directly via backend, run the following command:
```bash
npm run build
```
this will make a build directory, now replace the existing content in /backend/src/main/resources/static with the content in build directory.
